# Surfs Up

## Overview

The initial analysis of precipitation provided a solid foundation upon which to assess the feasibility of the entrepreneurship, however an additional analysis of the variation in seasonal temperature provides broader perspective into the viability of a year-round business model.

## Results

The results show:
  - June summary results are:
    - Avg Temperature: 75° F
    - Min Temperature: 64° F
    - Max Temperature: 85° F

  - December summary results are:
    - Avg Temperature: 71° F
    - Min Temperature: 56° F
    - Max Temperature: 83° F
  - [Dec Temps](Resources/dec.png)

## Summary

Comparing the results the variance between the average temperature is 4° F, however the variance in the max temperature is only 2° F. Reviewing the minimum temperatures we can see variance is 4 times the variance of the maximum temperatures. This could be an indication of a change in average temperatures trends over time, it could be atypical weather with a resulting deviation from the typical temperature pattern during the years analyzed, or it could be typical seasonal temperature variation for those times of year. Additional analysis covering a much larger time span could decisively demonstrate such. This includes whether there's a trend of change in temperature occuring over a longer period of time that could show how long a year-round business model for the surf shop would be viable. A similar analysis could be done with precipitation to ensure that yearly trends are stable and condusive to the success of a business venture that relies on good weather to be viable in the long term.
